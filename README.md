These are the voyages of the starship SPACEX, boldy going where no one has gone before. This app was written with React and fetches to the SpaceX API. The API seems to be a bit outdated, but it still has some neat info in there for the historical record. Design is a bit wonky, but I'm sure I'll get around to it.
